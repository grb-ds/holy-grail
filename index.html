            The holy grail is a web page layout which has multiple, equal
            height columns that are defined with style sheets. It is commonly
            desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in
            which it could be implemented with available technologies all had
            drawbacks.[1]
            Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to
            searching for the elusive Holy Grail.

        <p>
            The limitations of CSS and HTML, the desirability of semantically
            meaningful pages that rank well in search engines, and the deficiencies
            of various browsers combined historically to create a situation in which
            there was no way to create this type of layout that would be considered
            totally correct. As the underlying technologies did not provide a proper
            solution, web designers found various ways to work around the limitations.
            Common workarounds included changes in page structure, the addition of graphics,
            scripting, and the creative use of CSS. These methods were imperfect, inconvenient,
            and considered by some to be abuse of the web standards and their intent.

            More recent web standards have provided much more complete and robust solutions
            for implementing this layout. In particular, the CSS Flexible Box Layout and CSS
            Grid Layout modules have both provided full solutions.[2][3]
